## Objective
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create two versions of the game Rock, Paper Scissors. 
Each game model should be able to generate a random pick assigned to a computer. 
Each game model should also use class to class interation to update the data model of the Game and the Player. 
Each game should be able to detect a "Draw" when both players choose the same method. 
Through out the user's experience the HTML website should show reaction and give feedback based on the user's actions. A delay should consist after each game, giving the user a chance to see the results of the game.
